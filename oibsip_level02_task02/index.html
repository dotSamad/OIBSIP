            <p class="py-4">
                Khan was born on 2 November 1965 into a Muslim family in New Delhi. He spent the first five years of
                his life in Mangalore, where his maternal grandfather, Iftikhar Ahmed, served as the chief engineer of
                the port in the 1960s. Khan's father, Mir Taj Mohammed Khan, was an Indian independence
                activist from Peshawar who campaigned alongside the Khudai Khidmatgar, a nonviolent resistance movement
                led by Abdul Ghaffar Khan that sought a united and independent India. Mir was a follower of Abdul
                Ghaffar Khan, and affiliated with the Indian National Congress. He was also the cousin of the
                major general in the Indian National Army Shah Nawaz Khan. In 1946, Mir moved to Delhi to study law
                at Delhi University. When the partition of India occurred in 1947, he was forced to stay in Delhi,
                and did not return to Peshawar until many years later. As of 2010, Khan's paternal family was still
                living in the Shah Wali Qataal area of Peshawar's Qissa Khwani Bazaar. Khan's mother, Lateef Fatima,
                a magistrate, was the daughter of a senior government engineer. His parents were married in
                1959.

            <p class="py-4">
                Khan began his career with appearances in several television series in the late 1980s, and had his
                Bollywood debut in 1992 with Deewana. He was initially recognised for playing villainous roles in the
                films Baazigar (1993) and Darr (1993). Khan established himself by starring in a series of top-grossing
                romantic films, including Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995), Dil To Pagal Hai (1997), Kuch Kuch Hota
                Hai (1998), Mohabbatein (2000), Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001), Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003) and Veer-Zaara
                (2004). He earned critical acclaim for his portrayal of an alcoholic in Devdas (2002), a NASA scientist
                in Swades (2004), a hockey coach in Chak De! India (2007) and a man with Asperger syndrome in My Name Is
                Khan (2010). Further commercial successes came with the romantic dramas Om Shanti Om (2007) and Rab Ne
                Bana Di Jodi (2008), and with his expansion to comedies in Chennai Express (2013) and Happy New Year
                (2014). Following a brief setback and hiatus, Khan made a career comeback with the action film Pathaan
                (2023), which became the second-highest-grossing Hindi release.
